# Hello-World

I like to code, though it would be more fun if the computer language names have food in it. Though I think it's a better idea you just nickname them, such as JavaScript could have a nickname and it could be CookieScript. 

It would be funny and all, but it would ruin things. Many people will get confused that what happened to the names of the computer languages, and, since CookieScript is a really nonsense-like name, people who are not-in-the-mood for jokes would get annoyed, irritated, angry and whatever.

So my point is some things changed can be bad news or good news.
